# Piaget-Emotional-Biorobot 🧠 Piaget Emotional Biorobot – LDR + RGB Neuro-Feedback
Educational Piaget-based biorobot using an LDR and RGB LED. Light acts as a sensory stimulus and the system translates assimilation, accommodation and equilibrium into real-time colors. Low-cost project oriented to education with future data-driven AI potential. 
This educational biorobot is inspired by Jean Piaget’s theory of assimilation, accommodation and equilibrium. It uses an LDR sensor as sensory stimulus and a common-anode RGB LED as visual bio-feedback, translating environmental perception into cognitive states represented by colors.

⚙️ Technical operation

The LDR (A0) measures ambient light intensity.

The analog value is interpreted as sensory stimulus.

Three cognitive zones are defined:

🔵 Accommodation (low light, < 250): the environment challenges existing schemas.

🟢 Equilibrium (medium light, 250–600): stable integration.

🔴 Assimilation (high light, > 600): confirmation of prior schemas.

The common-anode RGB LED displays these states using inverted logic.

Cognitive states are also displayed through the Serial Monitor in real time.

🤖 Data-Driven AI Potential

This system can:

Log sensory input.

Label cognitive states.

Generate datasets for AI models focused on perception, adaptation and neuro-education.
It acts as a physical bridge between human stimulus, data and Artificial Intelligence.
